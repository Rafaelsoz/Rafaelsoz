# Hi, I'm Rafael Soz - Data Scientist, Statistician and I like to play with Rust to develop applications!

## ðŸ”Ž About Me:
I am a Data Science student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. During my academic journey, I have had contact with several programming languages, such as C, Java, Rust and, mainly, Python. In addition, I have explored different areas of statistics, including Classical, Bayesian and Nonparametric statistics.

My main area of â€‹â€‹interest is Data Science for structured and unstructured data, in which I use the Python language and its libraries, such as PyTirch, Sklearn, SciPy, among others.

I really enjoy developing applications in Rust, because, as it is a low-level language, it allows the implementation of custom algorithms and the creation of metaheuristic applications efficiently. In addition, it is possible to integrate Rust programs with Python, thus combining the best of both worlds.
